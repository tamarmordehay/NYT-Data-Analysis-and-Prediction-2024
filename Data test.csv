How to Choose the Best Clay Mask for Your Skin,"The earthy ingredient takes a more sophisticated turn in a number of new facial remedies, from melting creams to sheet masks.","Clay might not be the most high-tech beauty ingredient — the fine, earthy sediment has been used in facial remedies for centuries — but it’s one of the most efficient.

Yet, slathering on clay is not always pleasant: The mineral-rich substance has the texture of thick mud, is messy to apply and often becomes dry and flaky when spread on the face. But there is a better way. The latest wave of clay treatments come in innovative new formats — from soft creams to sheet masks to customizable powders — that can help clear out pores with minimal irritation (and frustration).

The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. “It’s now less fiesta and more tavern,” Mr. Stupak said.

The Artist Who Cooks Lunch for His Studio (Almost) Every Day,Xavier Veilhan has an unconventional work space but a traditional approach to the midday meal.,"For the mixed-media artist Xavier Veilhan, the studio is not only a place of work, it is also a place for living. While he notes that many of his peers in the visual-art world have rejected the convention of the studio to “work on airplanes and outsource their production,” he has adopted the opposite approach: “I do not have a fancy home or a beach house, I have this studio instead.” In 2007, he collaborated with the French architecture firm Bona-Lemercier to transform a ’60s-era storage hangar in Paris’s Bastille neighborhood into a space where he could produce and fabricate his work, which ranges from 3-D printed sculptures to ambitious installations like the recording studio he created in the French Pavilion at last year’s Venice Art Biennale. But he also wanted a place where he could cook intimate lunches and host the occasional party (every year, during Paris’s annual Fête de la Musique, he invites up to 500 of his friends into the studio to watch world-renowned D.J.s). The studio’s design, while delightfully unconventional — with its rounded blond-wood walls, nylon strap and net railings and floating portal-like doors — is precisely tailored to Veilhan’s needs.",Cooking and Cookbooks,News,T Magazine

Outrunning Hunger,Intense exercise may change the way certain neurons influence our appetite and metabolism.,"Exercise and eating have a fraught, unsettled relationship with each other. Workouts can blunt or boost appetites. People who start an exercise program often overeat and gain weight — and yet studies and lived experience demonstrate that regular exercise is needed to avoid regaining the weight lost during a successful diet. Intrigued by these contradictory outcomes, researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, along with colleagues from other institutions, ran an experiment on the melanocortin circuit, a brain network in the hypothalamus known to be involved in metabolism. The resulting study, published in December in Molecular Metabolism, suggests that intense exercise might change the workings of certain neurons in ways that could have beneficial effects on appetite and metabolism.",Exercise,News,Well

Finding the Comedy in Tween Tragedy,"A novel from Meg Wolitzer and Holly Goldberg Sloan, a revamp of the Baby-Sitters Club, and more in the latest funny books for middle-grade readers.","Mel Brooks said it best. “To me, tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.” When you’re 12, though, the line between comedy and tragedy can thin to the point of translucence.

Yet the freshest fears yield the greatest comedic bounty. True schadenfreude is built on seeing your fellow humans fail with epic splendor. That’s where books come in. Rather than encourage average kids’ bloodthirsty instinct to cheer for the downfall of their friends and neighbors, let them delve into the fiascos of fictional characters. Three funny new novels do precisely that, appealing to kids’ inclination to laugh at others’ foibles and, maybe in the course of things, themselves.",Books and Literature,Review,Books

He edited the “Encyclopédie,” for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts. Below, Curran talks about grave robbers, Diderot’s political prescience, how he was like Benjamin Franklin and more.","Curran, Andrew S",Question,Books

Lena Dunham Pays Homage to Her Late Literary Hero Diana Athill,"The British editor and writer, who died last week at 101, modeled a life of fierce, free-spirited independence.","Diana Athill spent most of her life as an editor, working with titans of literary history. They were mostly male — most anointed titans are — and the challenge of this job was immense enough to warrant a thick memoir, “Stet: An Editor’s Life.” Remarkably, Athill didn’t use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader’s life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined.",Books and Literature,News,Books

While new hotels (Limelight Hotel on the south end, Hotel Ketchum on the north) bookend Main Street, the half-mile stretch still exudes plenty of the old-time charm from Ketchum’s mining and sheep ranching heyday with cabin-style shops and historic brick buildings. Professional big-mountain skier and native Alexis “Lexi” du Pont describes Ketchum as “classy Western.” She says the area offers a great deal of history and a European influence from Sun Valley resort, which opened in the 1930s, “but at the same time it’s Wild West Idaho.” Here are five of her favorite places.",Skiing,News,Travel

How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,Asghar Farhadi’s films fill theaters in a country where taking sides can be dangerous. They’ve also captivated Hollywood.,"Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",Movies,News,Magazine

Calloway is a 27-year-old with a large Instagram following, built by chronicling her time as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge (picturesque lolling on the banks of the River Cam) and her daily life as a gal-about-town in New York City. Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on “true creative fulfillment.” What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them.
