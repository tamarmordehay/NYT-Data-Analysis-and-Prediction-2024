What Driving Can Teach Us About Living,How we respond to the rules of the road offers insight into being human.,2019-01-03T10:00:01+0000,By Rachel Cusk,1,"['Roads and Traffic', 'Great Britain']","Where I live, there is always someone driving slowly on the road ahead. This is by the sea in the English countryside, and the roads are narrow and burrow-like, with high hedges on either side to protect the fields from the coastal winds. The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour. No matter how many of them you get past, there’s always another one around the next bend.",Magazine,Magazine,News

Brown, the dean of the Gies College of Business, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is also a scholar of risk management. At his first faculty meeting four years ago, Brown fretted that his school had become, like many American universities, overly dependent on a single source of money — roughly a fifth of tuition revenue came from Chinese students. “I saw our reliance on China as a risk,” says Brown, noting that 800 or so of the university’s nearly 5,800 Chinese students attend the business school. “At the time, I was concerned that China could pull the plug on students coming to America. But then the U.S. political landscape shifted, and we were vulnerable to changing visa and immigration policies here, too. Both were threats we could not control.”",Magazine,Magazine,News

They decorate their bowers with scores of colorful objects, like flowers, berries, snail shells or, if they are near an urban area, bottle caps and plastic cutlery.

There was also a lot of talk among us about taking out any reference to social issues in the promotional materials, whether domestic violence or child abuse, and I was like, “I guess that makes sense.” But I’m torn about the effect that’s had, because on the one hand, the film is doing exactly what I want it to — young people who would go seek out a skateboard film anyway, it seems to be destroying them by the end emotionally.

But there is a better way. The latest wave of clay treatments come in innovative new formats — from soft creams to sheet masks to customizable powders — that can help clear out pores with minimal irritation (and frustration).

The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature — from formal gardens to underground caves — for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: “As I walked through all the narrow streets,” she says, “my gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies.” Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Miró, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series — now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City — is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,Asghar Farhadi’s films fill theaters in a country where taking sides can be dangerous. They’ve also captivated Hollywood.,2019-01-31T10:00:02+0000,By Giles Harvey,1,"['Movies', 'Iran', 'Farhadi, Asghar', 'Censorship', 'Muslims and Islam']","Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",Magazine,Magazine,News
