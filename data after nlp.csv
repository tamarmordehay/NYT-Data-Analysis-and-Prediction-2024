What Driving Can Teach Us About Living,How we respond to the rules of the road offers insight into being human.,"Where I live, there is always someone driving slowly on the road ahead. This is by the sea in the English countryside, and the roads are narrow and burrow-like, with high hedges on either side to protect the fields from the coastal winds. The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour.

Five Places to Visit in Beverly Hills,"Beverly Hills is an expensive place with a village-like charm, but it pays to know where to go. Cash Black, a bartender at one of its hot spots, shares his favorites.","Beverly Hills is more approachable than you might expect for a ZIP code typically associated with Lamborghinis and reality stars. It has a surprising number of sidewalk cafes and swaths of greenery. That village-like charm, coupled with residents’ famously refined palates, is what attracted Cash Black to the area seven years ago. “Jewelry. Cars. Wine. Beverly Hills has the best of the best. You don’t get to be here unless you really know what you’re doing,” said Mr. Black, a Las Vegas native, who began as a valet and worked his way up to head bartender at £10, a high-end Scotch bar tucked in the back of the Montage Beverly Hills hotel. He presides over the five-table bar as if it’s his own living room, occasionally bringing in his guitar to jam with clients. At ease with his customers’ seemingly unrestrained wealth (the Lalique crystal tumblers go for $650 apiece), Mr. Black, 31, has a startling command of whisky.

Shortcut Cooking From Jamie Oliver,"In “5 Ingredients,” the chef offers recipes for everyday meals, and some showstoppers, too.","Clever cookbooks with a limited number of ingredients per recipe are not new, but this one from the chef Jamie Oliver is notable for its ease and verve. Before he gets to the cooking he names his five “pantry heroes”: red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper and two olive oils, everyday and finer for finishing, staples that are not part of the ingredient tally. The book starts with salads, mostly as the center of the plate, and then goes on to simple pastas like one with canned tuna, capers and tiny tomatoes. There are sections on eggs, chicken, fish, various meats (beef dishes are mostly steaks) and desserts. To keep the ingredient count to five, Mr. Oliver bakes with self-rising flour and premade puff pastry and relies on prepared Asian condiments and sauces.

She could take steps toward regaining custody of her son from her boyfriend’s mother. “I needed to support myself,” she told me recently.

They decorate their bowers with scores of colorful objects, like flowers, berries, snail shells or, if they are near an urban area, bottle caps and plastic cutlery. Some bowerbirds even arrange the items in their collection from smallest to largest, forming a walkway that makes themselves and their trinkets all the more striking to a female — an optical illusion known as forced perspective that humans did not perfect until the 15th century.","Prum, Richard O",News,"bowerbird, male, flame","['male', 'flame', 'bowerbird', 'creatur', 'beauti', 'hue', 'plumag', 'transit', 'radianc', 'mate', 'male', 'speci', 'structur', 'assemblag', 'twig', 'spire', 'corridor', 'hut', 'bower', 'score', 'object', 'flower', 'berri', 'shell', 'area', 'bottl', 'cap', 'plastic', 'cutleri', 'bowerbird', 'item', 'collect', 'walkway', 'trinket', '—', 'illus', 'perspect', 'human', 'centuri']","extravagant, splendor, animal","['splendor', 'kingdom', 'select', '—']","beauty, making, scientist","['beauti', 'scientist', 'evolut']"

How to Choose the Best Clay Mask for Your Skin,"The earthy ingredient takes a more sophisticated turn in a number of new facial remedies, from melting creams to sheet masks.","Clay might not be the most high-tech beauty ingredient — the fine, earthy sediment has been used in facial remedies for centuries — but it’s one of the most efficient. When used in a paste or scrub, it is particularly adept at temporarily removing “surface oil and bacteria,” says the New York City dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, and can lead to a cleaner, brighter-looking complexion. Yet, slathering on clay is not always pleasant: The mineral-rich substance has the texture of thick mud, is messy to apply and often becomes dry and flaky when spread on the face. But there is a better way.

Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, “I might”), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. “At the expense of sounding immodest,” she said, the book is “really about the work I’ve done already that’s had national impact, and what I hope to come from it.” Below, Harris talks about how she connects personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.","Harris, Kamala D",Question,"harris, memoir, night","['kamala', 'harri', '’', 'memoir', 'truth', 'journey', '”', 'prologu', 'nov', 'night', 'harri', 'state', 'california', 'rest', 'book', 'matter', 'wake', 'night', 'thing', 'tenur', 'california', '’', 'attorney', 'gener', 'childhood', 'oakland', 'daughter', 'parent', 'father', 'economist', 'jamaica', 'mother', 'cancer', 'research', 'rumor', 'harri', 'run', 'minut', 'stephen', 'colbert', 'thursday', 'harri', 'coyli', '“', 'memoir', 'groundwork', 'campaign', '“', 'expens', '”', 'book', 'work', '’', 'impact', '”', 'talk', 'experi', 'life', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'news', 'cycl', 'inspir', 'bob', 'marley']","harris, discus, new","['harri', 'memoir', 'childhood', 'tenur', 'california', '’', 'attorney', 'gener', 'landscap']","kamala, harris, talk","['harri', 'talk', 'stori', 'truth']"

How Tarell Alvin McCraney Moved From ‘Moonlight’ to Broadway — and Beyond,His play “Choir Boy” just opened. His next film will air on Netflix. What ties his work together?

When I first met him, on the campus of Yale University, where he is chairman of the playwriting program — one of the most exclusive in the country, admitting only three students each year — it struck me that he was, if not distant, then at the very least aloof. Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche.

What was Salvation Taco is now under the management of Alex Stupak of Empellón, Taqueria and Al Pastor. (Mr. Stupak took over Salvation Taco last year after April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who ran the restaurant, left amid a sexual harassment scandal over Mr. Friedman’s treatment of employees.)

There’s also waiter service here.” Mr. Stupak said that he had resisted offers to turn Al Pastor into a fast-casual place in airports and food halls, and that he felt this project suited him better. The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. “It’s now less fiesta and more tavern,” Mr. Stupak said.

Ungulates see in two colors, yellow and blue, so avoid those hues if you’re hoping to go unnoticed by a deer. Cramer worked with an ophthalmic researcher to design his hunting patterns.

The Artist Who Cooks Lunch for His Studio (Almost) Every Day,Xavier Veilhan has an unconventional work space but a traditional approach to the midday meal.,"For the mixed-media artist Xavier Veilhan, the studio is not only a place of work, it is also a place for living. While he notes that many of his peers in the visual-art world have rejected the convention of the studio to “work on airplanes and outsource their production,” he has adopted the opposite approach: “I do not have a fancy home or a beach house, I have this studio instead.” In 2007, he collaborated with the French architecture firm Bona-Lemercier to transform a ’60s-era storage hangar in Paris’s Bastille neighborhood into a space where he could produce and fabricate his work, which ranges from 3-D printed sculptures to ambitious installations like the recording studio he created in the French Pavilion at last year’s Venice Art Biennale. But he also wanted a place where he could cook intimate lunches and host the occasional party (every year, during Paris’s annual Fête de la Musique, he invites up to 500 of his friends into the studio to watch world-renowned D.J.s). The studio’s design, while delightfully unconventional — with its rounded blond-wood walls, nylon strap and net railings and floating portal-like doors — is precisely tailored to Veilhan’s needs.",Cooking and Cookbooks,News,"studio, place, work","['artist', 'xavier', 'studio', 'place', 'work', 'place', 'live', 'peer', 'visualart', 'world', 'convent', 'studio', 'work', 'airplan', 'product', '”', 'approach', '“', 'home', 'beach', 'hous', 'studio', '”', 'architectur', 'firm', 'bonalemerci', 'storag', 'hangar', '’', 'bastil', 'neighborhood', 'space', 'work', 'sculptur', 'instal', 'record', 'studio', 'pavilion', 'year', 'art', 'biennal', 'place', 'lunch', 'parti', 'year', '’', 'fête', 'friend', 'studio', 'studio', '’', 'design', '—', 'blondwood', 'wall', 'strap', 'rail', 'door', '’', 'need']","xavier, veilhan, unconventional","['veilhan', 'work', 'space', 'approach', 'midday', 'meal']","artist, cook, lunch","['artist', 'lunch', 'studio', 'day']"

The city’s history is rich in literature — it was the home of Jorge Amado, among others — and intertwined with colonialism and the slave trade (Salvador was Brazil’s first capital, from 1549 to 1763). Today, its youthful energy and deep musical traditions make for a vibrant, often open-air night life, even when it’s not Carnaval (this year from Feb. 28 to March 5).

Outrunning Hunger,Intense exercise may change the way certain neurons influence our appetite and metabolism.,"Exercise and eating have a fraught, unsettled relationship with each other. Workouts can blunt or boost appetites. People who start an exercise program often overeat and gain weight — and yet studies and lived experience demonstrate that regular exercise is needed to avoid regaining the weight lost during a successful diet. Intrigued by these contradictory outcomes, researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, along with colleagues from other institutions, ran an experiment on the melanocortin circuit, a brain network in the hypothalamus known to be involved in metabolism. The resulting study, published in December in Molecular Metabolism, suggests that intense exercise might change the workings of certain neurons in ways that could have beneficial effects on appetite and metabolism.",Exercise,News,"exercise, metabolism, appetite","['exercis', 'eat', 'fraught', 'relationship', 'workout', 'appetit', 'peopl', 'exercis', 'program', 'weight', '—', 'studi', 'experi', 'demonstr', 'exercis', 'weight', 'outcom', 'research', 'univers', 'texa', 'center', 'colleagu', 'institut', 'experi', 'melanocortin', 'circuit', 'brain', 'network', 'hypothalamu', 'metabol', 'studi', 'decemb', 'metabol', 'exercis', 'work', 'neuron', 'way', 'effect', 'appetit', 'metabol']","intense, exercise, may","['exercis', 'way', 'neuron', 'appetit', 'metabol']","outrunning, hunger",['hunger']

Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.” When you’re 12, though, the line between comedy and tragedy can thin to the point of translucence.

Diderot Was Way Ahead of His Time — and He Knew It,"Andrew S.

Curran’s “Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely” will, among other things, make you feel very lazy. On a typical day, Curran points out, Diderot might “write on ancient Chinese and Greek music first thing in the morning, study the mechanics of a cotton mill until noon, help purchase some paintings for Catherine the Great in the afternoon, and then return home and compose a play and a 20-page letter to his mistress in the evening.” The 18th-century French philosopher (he was called “le philosophe” by his contemporaries; “the philosopher,” not “a philosopher”) was the most famous atheist of his generation. He edited the “Encyclopédie,” for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts. Below, Curran talks about grave robbers, Diderot’s political prescience, how he was like Benjamin Franklin and more.","Curran, Andrew S",Question,"curran, diderot, philosopher","['curran', '’', '“', 'diderot', 'art', '”', 'thing', 'day', 'point', 'diderot', 'music', 'thing', 'morn', 'studi', 'mechan', 'cotton', 'mill', 'noon', 'help', 'paint', 'catherin', 'afternoon', 'home', 'play', 'letter', 'mistress', 'even', 'philosoph', 'le', 'philosoph', '”', 'contemporari', 'philosoph', 'philosoph', '”', 'atheist', 'gener', '“', 'encyclopédi', '”', 'articl', 'art', 'critic', 'novelist', 'writer', 'satirist', 'death', 'dozen', 'manuscript', 'gener', 'thought', 'curran', 'talk', 'grave', 'robber', 'prescienc', 'benjamin', 'franklin']","andrew, curran, talk","['andrew', 'talk', '“', 'diderot', 'art', 'book', 'philosoph', 'work', '—', 'death']","diderot, way, ahead","['diderot', 'way', 'time', '—']"

What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader’s life, provided a lifeline.

Pitching the manuscript to a local government official he thinks might subsidize its publication, the author is at pains to describe it in resolutely anti-commercial terms.

How to Win an Argument,Don’t lead with your strongest points. Anticipate miscommunication.

It isn’t enough, in other words, to dwell only on the strengths of your own position. Accept that an issue like whether to increase the minimum wage, for example, can have strong reasons on both sides. “I could give very good considerations in favor of my side of the policy,” Mashwama says, “but those might not be relevant in light of the actual reasons my opponent has an opposing opinion.” This is common on social media, he adds; too often, people aren’t listening to one another.

How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,Asghar Farhadi’s films fill theaters in a country where taking sides can be dangerous. They’ve also captivated Hollywood.,"Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",Movies,News,"farhadi, film, day","['asghar', 'director', 'histori', 'cinema', 'interest', 'polit', 'polit', 'jan', 'week', 'salesman', '”', 'farhadi', '’', 'featur', 'film', 'award', 'foreignlanguag', 'movi', 'presid', 'trump', 'execut', 'order', 'ban', 'term', 'citizen', 'muslimmajor', 'countri', 'state', 'day', 'time', 'presid', '“', 'hell', '”', 'farhadi', 'connoisseur', 'particular', 'film', 'fault', 'line', 'iran', 'audienc', 'world', 'trump', '’', 'order', 'statement', 'day', 'decis', 'oscar', 'histori', '“', 'humili', '”', 'hostil', 'circumst', 'punish', 'group', '”', 'equanim', '—', 'anyon', 'film', 'farhadi', 'inquest', 'claim', 'parti']","asghar, farhadi, film","['asghar', 'farhadi', '’', 'film', 'theater', 'countri', 'side', 'hollywood']","iran, greatest, director","['’', 'director', 'art', 'ambigu']"

Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on “true creative fulfillment.” What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them.

The Danish Designer Making Fanciful Dresses With a Dark Side,"Cecilie Bahnsen has won a loyal following for her frilled and intricately embroidered pieces, but now she’s experimenting with a less innocent mood.","Five days after Christmas, the Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen stood in her serenely decorated basement studio in Osterbro, a leafy residential neighborhood in eastern Copenhagen, with one of her team members. They considered all of the work that still needed to be done for her fall 2019 runway collection, her fifth to date, which was showing in a month. She had an idea, but it had not yet translated into a single garment. “Something interesting often arises from situations where you feel cornered or under pressure. It adds a dynamic that you can’t create on your own,” she reflected recently, as she walked through her narrow studio on a misty January afternoon. Her pace seemed surprisingly calm for a designer who was 72 hours out from her show. “It actually hasn’t been that hectic this time around, compared to the first couple of shows that we did,” she added.",Dresses,News,"designer, studio, show","['day', 'design', 'cecili', 'bahnsen', 'basement', 'studio', 'osterbro', 'neighborhood', 'copenhagen', 'team', 'member', 'work', 'fall', 'runway', 'collect', 'fifth', 'date', 'month', 'idea', 'garment', '“', 'someth', 'situat', 'pressur', 'creat', '”', 'studio', 'afternoon', 'pace', 'design', 'hour', 'show', 'time', 'coupl', 'show']","cecilie, bahnsen, loyal","['cecili', 'bahnsen', 'loyal', 'piec', 'mood']","danish, designer, making","['design', 'dress', 'side']"

They didn’t jibe with my impression of the writer’s appearance as taken from a photograph on the cover of the 1955 paperback edition of “Notes of a Native Son,” which I owned and treasured when I was a teenager, and a copy of which you’ll find on display toward the start of the exhibition “God Made My Face: A Collective Portrait of James Baldwin” at David Zwirner.",Art,Review,"father, reason, doubt","['father', 'year', 'boy', 'reason', 'jame', 'father', '’', 'word', 'reason', 'jibe', 'impress', 'writer', '’', 'appear', 'photograph', 'cover', 'paperback', 'edit', 'note', 'son', '”', 'teenag', 'copi', 'display', 'start', 'exhibit', '“', 'god', 'face', 'portrait', 'jame', '”', 'david', 'zwirner']","part, literary, figure","['figur', 'subject', 'group', 'exhibit', 'yorker', 'hilton', 'al', 'part', 'part', 'studi', 'influenc', 'artist']","james, baldwin, pessimist","['jame', 'optimist', 'hero']"
